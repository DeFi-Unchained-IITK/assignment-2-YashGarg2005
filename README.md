# Assignment-2

## Question 1 :

1.created a constructor for using msg.sender as shared in code blocks

2.Used simple logic for telling prime numbers like in c++

3.Used 2 revert call functions that help to check that number is greater than 1[prime no are greater than 1] and second is a boolean to check if number is prime.

## Question 2 :

I have created a employeeregistree contract and employee struct as defined in the question then used mapping from id to the struct.
I have a common event value(uint string string uint) for compilation of logs

Then I have four functions
1. **AddEmployee** - takes the required Employee properties(name, position, salary) and adds the Employee to the mapping.
2. **UpdateEmployee** - takes the input id, updated name, position and salary and updates the same in the mapping.
3. **GetEmployeeDetails** - takes the input id and returns the Employeeâ€™s name, position and salary.
4. **DeleteEmployee** - takes the input id and deletes the employee from the mapping.

for the last three questions I have used revert call back by require keyword to ensure that ID is valid

**Issue with the code** - If we use the DelEmployee then that ID can't be updated only unique ID are allowed

## Question 3 :

I have created a Library contract with book struct and to mapping for starage of data


1. **AddBook** - takes the book details(name, author) and adds the book to books mapping.
2. **BorrowBook** - takes input the book id, checks if the book is available and assigns the book to the user (i.e. adds the book the borrowed_books mapping).
3. **GetBookDetails** - takes input the book id and returns the book details.
4. **ReturnBook** - checks if the book was borrowed by the user calling the function or not and takes back the book (i.e. removes it from the mapping borrowed_books).


**Issue with the code** - If we use the DelEmployee then that ID can't be updated only unique ID are allowed
